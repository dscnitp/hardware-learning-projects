To train the members and make them competent for big projects, training modules have been given.<br/>
All the Taks assigned to them are simulated online on [TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/) and have been sumitted on given deadline to ensure discipline and routined learning<br/>

Given Tasks are described below, please explore the repository to have a look at the submissions. All submissions have been arranged in designated folders with work of eak=ch memeber on the task in a folder of his/her name.
